# Rocket Boost Game

## Game Description
Pilot a rocket through challenging levels using realistic physics controls. Navigate obstacles and land safely on green landing zones to progress through 3 increasingly difficult stages.

## How to Play
- **Goal**: Successfully land your rocket on the green landing zone
- **Progression**: Complete 3 levels with increasing difficulty
- **Challenge**: Master rocket physics and precise landing techniques

## Controls
- **Boost**: Spacebar (rocket thrust)
- **Steering**: Left/Right Arrow Keys (rotate rocket)
- **Quit**: ESC key

## Level Features
- **Level 1**: Straight-line course with basic obstacles to navigate around
- **Level 2**: Vertical maze requiring constant up and down maneuvering
- **Level 3**: Multi-path course with dead ends - choose wisely or backtrack!
- **Landing Zones**: Green areas that trigger level progression
- **Physics Simulation**: Realistic gravity and momentum effects

## Game Features
- Physics-based rocket movement
- Progressive level difficulty
- Audio feedback system
- Moving obstacle mechanics
- Collision detection and response
- Scene transition system

## Technical Info
- **Unity Version**: 6.1
- **Platform**: PC (Windows/Mac/Linux)
- **Course Reference**: Based on GameDev.tv Unity materials

## Setup
1. Clone this repository  
2. Open in Unity 6.1 or later
3. Open the first scene and press Play
4. Use Spacebar and Arrow Keys to control rocket
5. Land on green zones to advance levels

## Scripts Overview
- `Movement.cs` - Rocket thrust and rotation controls
- `CollisionHandler.cs` - Collision detection and level transitions
- `Oscillator.cs` - Moving platform and obstacle animations
- `QuitApplication.cs` - Game exit functionality

## Tips
- Use short bursts of thrust instead of continuous boost
- Approach landing zones slowly and steadily
- Practice controlling rotation before attempting landings
- Watch for moving obstacles and time your movements
- Remember: smooth and controlled wins over fast and reckless!
